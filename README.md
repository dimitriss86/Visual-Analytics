# Visual Analytics of London Underground Traffic

## Project Overview
This repository contains the visual analytics project examining changes in London Underground traffic patterns before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis focuses on differences in commuting behaviors, station traffic, and peak usage periods, highlighting the adaptability of urban transit systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Yearly Comparison**: Traffic data from 2020 and 2022 to understand the impact of the pandemic.
- **Visual Analytics**: Utilizes various visualization tools to depict traffic trends and anomalies.
- **Insightful Observations**: Insights into commuter flow changes, aiding future public transport planning.
- **Pre vs. Post-Pandemic Traffic**: Analysis of traffic patterns before and during the pandemic to understand shifts in commuter behavior.
- **Shifts in Peak Hours**: Investigation into how traditional rush hours have shifted or spread out due to flexible work arrangements and social distancing measures.
- **Station-Specific Trends**: Identifies which stations saw significant traffic increases or decreases, possibly related to changes in nearby residential or commercial areas.
